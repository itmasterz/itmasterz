We all know that internet download manager categorizes files and saves the downloads accordingly.
its difficult to view the files directly.
the following project will direct all those categories to a single downloads directory.

steps to follow:
1.close the idm.
2.ensure that the idm is completely closed(including taskbar).
3.run the patcher.
4.relaunch the idm.
5.try downloading the files.
6.if any issues please try rebooting the pc, the code is tested and working on all windows platforms.

thanks in advance keep supporting :)ITmasterz
